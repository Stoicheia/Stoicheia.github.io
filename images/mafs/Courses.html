                Here is a list of all the undergraduate courses I have or am taking at ANU grouped by semester with a brief overview of some of the content I have learned and my thoughts and reflections of these courses. You could also call this a diary of some sort of my undergraduate era which future me can look back on.

                    This is probably the most mathematical course I've taken in first year. Algebra 1 gives a great foundation to modern algebra concepts such as Group Theory and Ring Theory with a bit of modules. It was not too hard but there were a lot of new definitions to take in. The main theorems we went through were the Isomorphism theorems, Sylow theorems and the Structure theorem which are helpful for classifying groups.

                    <p class = "Indent"> The course also offered extension content which dealt with representing finite groups as linear transformations over vector spaces. To be honest I've already forgotten most of what I have learnt at the time I'm writing this (June 2020) though I remember we proved some cool results including being able to classify all irreducible representations of finite groups using Young diagrams and Cayley's Theorem (every finite group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of a symmetric group acting on G). </p>

                <div class = "CourseInfo"> 
                    This was the follow up course for Math1115 but a bit more interesting since all the basic stuff is out of the way. Linear algebra was actually good since we moved away from matrices and started to introduce more complex and interesting theory about vector spaces. The analysis part however was more focused on proofs for applications, such as multivariable calculus and series. I found the content and the teaching of this course more enjoyable and engaging than Math1115.

                    Similar to Math1005 in the sense that it was not at all challenging, but the course did introduce some interesting computer theory such as grammars, automata, Turing machines and solvability. Though this content came much later in the course while the first half was about basic boolean algebra and computer proofs with Hoare logic and natural deduction which I did not enjoy.

                    A first year Java course you would probably expect in any first year computer science or software engineering degree. Relatively straightforward course whose main focus was the major group assignment where we had to implement a board game completely from scratch. The only advanced part of this course was how we had to implement another game playing AI in our program, but this time the game had a much larger search tree. Implented Monte Carlo simulation and won the respective competition.

                </div>
                <div class = "CourseInfo"> 
                    Just as the course name suggests, this course was an introduction to university mathematics in the sense of writing proofs and problem solving. The course does not really focus on a single topic (with topics ranging from combinatorics, graph theory and recurrence relations), it succeeded in teaching us how to construct pro mathematical arguments and proofs. Basically a superior and more challenging version of Math1005 due to its dedicated demographic. The final exam was probably the hardest first year exam I have done.

                <div class = "CourseInfo"> 
                    Described to be the 'hardest first year course in the Southern hemisphere', this course was like two courses in one focused on introductory analysis and linear algebra. I guess the difficulty of the course is attributed to the introduction of proof based mathematics which most students would not be familiar with given how this course compulsory for degrees outside mathematics. Content learned included proving the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus by building up the theory of calculus and analysis from the ground up using rigorous definitions and real number axioms, and an introduction to matrices and linear algebra.

                    A compulsory course for my CS degree to check of the mathematics requisites. Super straightforward for 90% of the course content except for the final topics dealing with graph algorithms and Markov chains. Assessments were very easy as questions were either simple computations or of the form 'apply' this algorithm and did not require much thinking. Felt like I wasted a course here since I could have learnt most of this stuff myself.

                <div class = "CourseInfo"> 
                    An enjoyable introductory programming course taught in Haskell. It was a pretty unorthodox course but get its job done for teaching basic computer science concepts such as data structures, recursion, time complexity and algorithms etc. using functional programming. The advanced version of the course also taught lambda calculus and program proofs, the latter which I found pretty boring. A highlight of the course was the final assignment where we get to implement a game playing agent using minimax and alpha-beta pruning to compete against other students. Came 11th overall which was an alright result.
