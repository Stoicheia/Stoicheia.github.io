<h2>What they don't teach you in Japanese class</h2>
<h3>Pitch accent</h3>
<h4>Introduction to Japanese pitch</h4>
<p class="text">
	Each mora (kana) in Japanese can be of one of two different pitches - high or low. Each Japanese word has an associated "pitch accent". If a word has <em>n</em> morae, then the accent is an integer <em>k</em> between <em>0</em> and <em>n</em> inclusive. Then the pitches of the morae of this word are, with mora numbers marked in order, low(1)-high(2)-high(3)-...-high(k)-low(k+1)-...-low(n) if <em>k>1</em>, high(1)-low(2)-low(3)-...-low(n) if <em>k=1</em>, and low(1)-high(2)-high(3)-...-high(n) if <em>k=0</em>. We place the accent mark (’) after the accented mora like this: たべ’る. Obviously, words with <em>0</em> accent will have no accent mark: わたし. The accent never falls on ん, っ (small つ), or the second mora of a long vowel. If an accent is ever in one of these afformentioned illegal positions, it moves backwards until it reaches a legal position. Keep in mind that the same word may have different accents based on their part of speech or grammatical function in a sentence. 
</p>
<h4>Phonology of pitch</h4>
<p class="text">
	In normal speech, the high pitch is approximately a major third higher than the low pitch. As a general rule, a wider gap between high and low pitch indicates greater speaker engagement. In two-morae syllables, that is, long vowels or vowels followed by ん, a low-high pattern is articulated as an unbroken long rising tone, and a high-low pattern is articulated as an unbroken long falling tone. In words with accent not equal to <em>1</em>, the first low mora can be arbitrarily rendered as high.
</p>
<h4>Pitch in sentence fragments</h4>
<p class="text">
	A "fragment" describes one unit of continuous, uninterrupted speech. This is typically one sentence or phrase. Each fragment has only one accent. After the first accent in a fragment, all subsequent morae in that fragment have low pitch, meaning all subsequent accents in that fragment are ignored. If the fragment is a question, then the last mora will have a rising (low-high) tone. If the second-to-last mora is accented, the last mora could also be rendered with a rising tone.
</p>
<h4>Verbs</h4>
<p class="text">
	There are two regular categories of verbs based on pitch. Strong verbs and weak verbs. Strong verbs with <em>n</em> syllables have accent <em>n</em>. Weak verbs have accent <em>0</em>. These accents may change based on conjugation. Here are some examples:
</p>
<h4>Strong Verbs</h4>
<p class="text">
	たべ’る&emsp;たべま’す
<br>たべ’ない&emsp;たべませ’ん
<br>たべよ’う&emsp;たべましょ’う
<br>たべられ’る&emsp;たべられま’す
<br>た’べた&emsp;たべま’した
